Most people are in their house, using computers, on their laptops, and on their mobile phones. If you are not taking advantage of the trend that most people spend their time on their gadgets then you are missing out! BIG TIME!</p>\n<p>So stay sitted, get a cup of coffee (or tea) as I guide you.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>SET YOUR GOAL!</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I think in almost everything, the first thing you should do is setting your goal. Why don't you start asking you the basic questions (write yours now!) like \"What's my objective?\", \"What do I want to achieve?\" doing this will help you get a clearer picture when strategizing your social medial marketing. Remember, your objective/s in doing social media marketing should be in line with your business goal!</p>\n<p>Is your list of questions complete? (good!) Now, your goals should be SPECIFIC don't dilly dally on your goals, setting a specific goal will help you put your effort in the right direction. MEASURABLE, goals you set should be measurable, this way you will be able to see the actual numbers you set for yourself and business. In setting your goals in numeric form, you will be able to adjust them accordingly. ATTAINABILITY, setting an unrealistic goal is fine (believe it or not) however, your goal should be according to your capability, resources, and time. RELEVANCY - the goals you set should relevant not only to you but to your business overall. Set your TIME-TABLE, in setting your time table you are creating a sense of urgency in order to achieve them. Sometimes a goal without a time frame will only get kick around and can cause you to procrastinate.</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>KNOW YOUR TARGET AUDIENCE AND CREATE A BUYER PERSONAS</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Knowing your target audience will help you create a strategy that will suit them perfectly. You should conduct research in order to find who they are. There is a lot of free social media analytics you can use to help you identify your target audience, with the help of each (whichever you use) you can then know how you will cater to them. Once you gather all the information, now you know your target audience, you know what do they need, their pain points with all the data you gathered, you can create a buyer's persona.</p>\n<p>So once you created this you can now devise a campaign that will address specific pain points. Better targeting means better results.</p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>CHOOSING THE RIGHT CHANNEL</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Since you already created a buyer's persona, you should be able to select the proper social media channel you need to use in order to reach them. Please know that identifying the social media channel your target audience will save you a lot of time, money, and effort. Also, know that not all social media channel is important for your business. See the image below to be guided accordingly.</p>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li>KNOW YOUR COMPETITOR</li>\n</ol>\n<p>In any competition, knowing your competitor is half the battle. So, make a list of your top competitors and get to know them. Again, there are free platforms you can use to research your competitors. You should know what they are doing and not doing. You should study their behavior as well as how they use each social media channel. Compare your strategy with what they are doing, identify which is working and which is not. You can also adapt their strategy to yours if you see fit (there's nothing wrong with that).</p>\n<p>Once you have done all this research and you have all the data, create a SWOT Analysis. You need to make a list of your strengths and weaknesses and compare them to your competitors. </p>\n<ol start=\"5\">\n<li>DECIDE WHICH TYPE OF CONTENT YOU WANT TO SHARE.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Once you decide which social media you want to use (one where most of your audience is) you should also decide on which content to share, know that each social media channel is unique and have specific content. Have you noticed anything about celebrities? Celebrity gathers a mass following because they know how to utilize each social media channel they are on, they know how to use it.</p>\n<ol start=\"6\">\n<li>OPTIMIZE YOUR SOCIAL MEDIA ACCOUNT</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Creating social media specifically for your business is really ideal.  Once you have one, make sure that it is consistent with your branding, your message, and your culture. Having consistency on your platform will make it easier for your audience to remember who you are and recognize your brand.</p>\n<ol start=\"7\">\n<li>KNOW WHEN TO POST</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Knowing the best time to post your content will help you reach more of your audience. You can see in the image below what is the best time to post on each social media channel. </p>\n<p>You should create a social media calendar, in which you can put when to post on your social media account and what to post each time. This will also create consistency in posting and sharing.</p>\n<ol start=\"8\">\n<li>ENGAGE WITH YOUR AUDIENCE.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Even celebrities engage with their fans from time to time. Interacting with your audience will create a loyal follower in which they can become your own brand ambassadors. Many businesses actually neglect this part, sharing and posting are not all that you can do to help them know you. If someone comment on your post, engage with them. Did someone send you a message? Chat with them. Not only this will create a community for your follower but you will also create trust for your brand.</p>\n<ol start=\"9\">\n<li>USE PAID PROMOTIONS.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Many people are afraid to use an ad. They think it is a waste of money and not effective. This is true and not true, let me explain. </p>\n<p>Using social media ad is something that should not be taken lightly, you should know how to do it and when to do it. When it is done properly it will help you increase your audience quickly. So set a budget for your advertising.</p>\n<ol start=\"10\">\n<li>MONITOR AND ADAPT</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Once you roled out your campaign, you should always monitor them. See where you at with your goal, see if your campaign is producing the results you wanted them to. Monitor the progress of each campaign on each platform this way you will be able to adjust and adapt. Make a report for a daily or weekly basis. </p>"}}]}},"pageContext":{}}}
